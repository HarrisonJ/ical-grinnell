I believe that the most important files for the people that are going to be generating the printable output file are 
	1. dataStructures.h
	2. calSystem.h


dataStructures.h:
	this defines all of the data structures that are used in the system(at least the ones we defined)
	The over all structure is
	work_week:
		misc info
		an array of 7 pointers to work_days
	work_day:
		a pointer to the first event_node of the day. 
		NOTE: currently this is a rather pointless data structure, however I think that we may want to add
		more fields to the work_day type in the future
	event_node:
		start and ending time of the event
		summary of the event (this is likely the name of the event)
		location of the event
		time string: a string that has the form hh:mm - hh:mm
		options: a pointer to a node_options structure
		next_event: the next event 
	node_options:
		box_color: the color the event box representing the event should be colored on the printed version
		text_color: the color the text should be
		*_font: the font that __ should be. 



calSystem.h:
	This has the top level functions.

	createConfiguration: it creates the configuration_info structure that will be used in the rest of the program. Currently it
		just calls defaultConfiguration, but in the future we will likely modify it so it can also read from a file. 

	createWorkWeekFromFile: this does exactly what is says, given a file name and configInfo it will create
		return a pointer to a work_week structure, 

	createPrintableFile: this is just a stub this creates the final file.

NOTE: several of the data structures have redundant information. 

TODO:
	TESTING!!!!!!
	FILL out stubs:
		postProcessEvents.c:
			eventSpansTwoDays
			splitEvent
			truncateTime
			setColors (later)
			setFonts (later)
		calSystem.c
			createPrintableFile
			createConfiguration (later)
